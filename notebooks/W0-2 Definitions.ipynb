    "## Definitions used in this course\n",
    "\n",
    "CEN EN 13306 (2017) is the European Committe for Standardization's Maintenance - Maintenance Terminology Standard (2017) and specifies generic terms and definitions for the technical, administrative and managerial areas of maintenance. Many of the definitions given below are identical (or very close in intent) to the widely used ISO 14224 (2016) standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Maintenance_ : combination of all technical, administrative and managerial actions during the life cycle of an item intended to retain it in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform the required function.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Required function_ : function, combination of functions, or a total combination of functions of an item which are considered necessary to fulfil a given requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Maintenance Strategy_ : management method used in order to achieve the maintenance objectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Maintenance Objectives_: targets assigned and accepted for the maintenance activities.  \n",
    "Note 1 to entry: These targets may include for example availability, cost reduction, product quality, environment preservation, safety, useful life, asset value preservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions for other terms we will use in this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure related terms\n",
    "\n",
    "`Failure`: loss of the ability of an item to perform a required function.  \n",
    "Note 1 to entry: After failure the item has a fault, which may be complete or partial.  \n",
    "Note 2 to entry: \"Failure\" is an event, as distinguished from \"fault\", which is a state.  \n",
    "Note 3 to entry: The concept as defined does not apply to items consisting of software only.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Failure mode`: manner in which the inability of an item to perform a required function occurs.  \n",
    "Note 1 to entry: A failure mode may be defined by the function lost or the state transition that occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Failure cause`: circumstances during specification, design, manufacture, installation, use or maintenance that result in failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Failure mechanism`: physical, chemical or other processes which may lead or have led to failure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`Hidden failure`: failure which is not detected during normal operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Activity related terms\n",
    "\n",
    "`Corrective maintenance`: maintenance carried out after fault recognition and intended to restore an item into a state in which it can perform a required function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Preventative maintenance`: maintenance carried out intended to assess and/or to mitigate degradation and reduce the probability of failure of an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Improvement`: combination of all technical, administrative and managerial actions, intended to ameliorate the intrinsic reliability and/or maintainability and/or safety of an item, without changing the original function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Modification`: combination of all technical, administrative and managerial actions intended to change one or more functions of an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Condition-based maintenance`: preventive maintenance which include assessment of physical conditions, analysis and the possible ensuing maintenance actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Predictive maintenance`: condition-based maintenance carried out following a forecast derived from repeated analysis or known characteristics and evaluation of the significant parameters of the degradation of the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pre-determined maintenance` (also known as fixed interval maintenance): preventive maintenance carried out in accordance with established intervals of time or number of units of use but without previous condition  investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metric-related terms\n",
    "\n",
    "`Reliability`: ability of an item to perform a required function under given conditions for a given time interval.  \n",
    "Note 1 to entry: The reliability of an item could be calculated from the observed failures of it or/and set of comparable items during a given time interval.  \n",
    "Note 2 to entry: The forecasted reliability of an item expresses the level of confidence on it, estimated from the observed reliability of comparable items and the knowledge about its actual state.  \n",
    "Note 3 to entry: In some cases a given number of unit of use can be considered instead of a given time interval, (number of cycles, number of running hours, number of km, etc.).  \n",
    "Note 4 to entry: The given conditions may include preventive maintenance actions and operational modes and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Availability`: ability of an item to be in a state to perform as and when required, under given conditions, assuming that the necessary external resources are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison below are the failure definitions from ISO 14224: 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "- Failure mode: manner in which a failure occurs (Source ISO 14224:2016 from IEC 60050-192:2015, 192-03-17)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Failure cause: set of circumstances that leads to failure (Source ISO 14224:2016 from IEC 60050-192:2015, 192-03-11) \n",
    "\n",
    "- Failure effect: consequence of a failure mode in terms of the operation, function or status of the item (Source AS IEC 60812) \n",
    "\n",
    "- Failure mechanism:  process that leads to failure. (Source ISO 14224:2016 from IEC 60050-192:2015, 192-03-12)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common mode failures:  failures of different items characterized by the same failure mode (Source ISO 14224:2016 from IEC 60050-192:2015, 192-03-19)\n",
